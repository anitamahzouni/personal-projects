# personal-projects
Hi, I'm Anita, a high school student. 

I love technology, coding, and AI, and I am also interested in business/project management.

Some other things about me are:
  - I love to be social
  - I love playing chess and sudoku
  - I knit and crochet
  - My favourite animals are hedghogs
  
This is a compilation of a few of my personal projects!
